    RadiKS also provides an opportunity for kouriers to become independent
    contractors. Kouriers can sign up on the RadiKS website or mobile app to
    start receiving delivery requests from customers. Kouriers are paid per
    delivery and can choose to accept or decline delivery requests. In the event
    of a delivery request being bounced from Kourier to Kourier without any
    takers due to, for example, the delivery address being in a high-risk zone
    such as the Burbclaves please be advised that you as a Kourier have a
    responsibility to: show up for the delivery, don't put the package in danger
    and to get the package to the customer in a timely fashion.

    RadiKS contractors implement a sophisticated mobility system to beat the
    traffic: A RadiKS provided Slide-board and a poon-gun. The slide-board and

  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li>launch the kourier over top of the traffic,</li>
    <li>
      and then the poon-gun is used to bounce the kourier from car to car until
      they reach their destination.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-2">
    Kouriers must be highly trained and skilled in order to safely use this
    system.
