NOTICE ABOUT SAFETY:

RadiKS contractors implement a sophisticated mobility system to beat the traffic: A RadiKS provided Slide-board and a poon-gun. The slide-board and poon-gun work together to 

-launch the courier over top of the traffic, 
-and then the poon-gun is used to bounce the courier from car to car until they reach their destination. 

Couriers must be highly trained and skilled in order to safely use this system.

In the event of a serious accident 

-RadiKS has a no-fault policy, and 
-couriers are not covered by RadiKS insurance. 

Couriers are encouraged to purchase their own insurance.  Accidents happen, and RadiKS is here to be your friend in the all too common case of an uninsured accident. With that said, we are not your parents. 

-We will not pay your medical bills, 
-or replace your lost wages, 
-or new phone, 
-or anything else.

Again, please get insurance.
